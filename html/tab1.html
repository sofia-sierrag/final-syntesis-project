  Electrical energy is a type of kinetic energy caused by moving electric
  charges. The amount of energy depends on the speed of the charges – the faster
  they move, the more electrical energy they carry. Let's imagine an electric
  charge is represented by a ball being thrown against a window. If you don't
  throw the ball very fast, it won't have enough energy to break the window. But
  if you throw the ball faster, it will have more energy and will be able to
  smash through the window. The faster you throw the ball, the more energy it
  will have to break the window. </br>

  Static Electricity </br>
  Static Electricity is nothing but the contact between equal
  amount of protons and electrons (positively and negatively charged subatomic
  particles). In order to make this friction work the particles are supposed to
  be of opposite nature (+,-). If two same-kind particles i.e. positive-positive
  or negative-negative, it would then be called as a ‘Non-friction’. Current
  Electricity Current Electricity is a flow of electric charge across an
  electrical field. This current is lead through a conductor. The conductors are
  generally of two types, Good and Bad conductors. Good conductors are the ones
  which let the electric charge flow through them (Copper wires) and the bad
  conductors are the ones which resists the electric charge (Wood). The constant
  flow of electric charge causes the conductor to heat up very often. Solar
  Electricity Solar Electricity is generated with the only power that has been
  in existence since the living breathed on this planet, the huge and singular
  source named as Sun. The sun rays are the only source in Solar Electricity. It
  is generated with the help of Photovoltaic (PV) technology by converting solar
  energy into solar electricity from sunlight. PV Systems use sunlight to power
  ordinary electrical equipments for example: household appliances, computers &
  lightings. Hydro Electricity Hydro Electricity is generated by harnessing the
  power of moving water. It is manufactured in large power generating stations
  using the same basic principle of a small grist mill yet on a much larger and
  vastly improved scale for better efficiency. Electrical generators are
  attached to huge turbine devices which spin at great speeds as a result of
  water rushing through them.

  The watt (abbreviated W) is the International System of Units' (SI) standard
  unit of power (energy per unit time), the equivalent of one joule per second.
  The watt is used to specify the rate at which electrical energy is dissipated,
  or the rate at which electromagnetic energy is radiated, absorbed, or
  dissipated. When an opposition force of one Newton is applied to an object and
  its velocity is kept constant at one meter per second, the rate of work done
  is said to be one watt.

  In science, the scatterplot is widely used to present measurements of two or
  more related variables. It is particularly useful when the values of the
  variables of the y-axis are thought to be dependent upon the values of the
  variable of the x-axis. In a scatterplot, the data points are plotted but not
  joined. The resulting pattern indicates the type and strength of the
  relationship between two or more variables. Correlations may be positive
  (rising), negative (falling), or null (uncorrelated). If the dots' pattern
  slopes from lower left to upper right, it indicates a positive correlation
  between the variables being studied. If the pattern of dots slopes from upper
  left to lower right, it indicates a negative correlation.

  Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by
  fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be
  an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent
  variable. For example, a modeler might want to relate the weights of
  individuals to their heights using a linear regression model. It is not
  necessary that here one variable is dependent on others, or one causes the
  other, but there is some critical relationship between the two variables. In
  such cases, we use a scatter plot to imply the strength of the relationship
  between the variables. If there is no relation or linking between the
  variables, the scatter plot does not indicate any increasing or decreasing
  pattern. For such cases, the linear regression design is not beneficial to the
  given data.

  Renewable energy comes from sources or processes that are constantly
  replenished. These sources of energy include solar energy, wind energy,
  geothermal energy, and hydroelectric power. Renewable sources are often
  associated with green energy and clean energy, but there are some subtle
  differences between these three energy types. Where renewable sources are
  those that are recyclable, clean energy are those that do not release
  pollutants like carbon dioxide, and green energy is that which comes from
  natural sources. While there is often cross-over between these energy types,
  not all types of renewable energy are actually fully clean or green. For
  example, some hydroelectric sources can actually damage natural habitats and
  cause deforestation. Renewable energy is important as it has the potential to
  provide a ready supply of power without using natural resources. There is also
  a lower risk of environmental problems like fuel spills and minimal issues
  with emissions, while also reducing the need for imported fuels.
