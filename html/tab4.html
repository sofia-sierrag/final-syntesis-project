    <h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
    <p>This second part of the project must be done individual.
      For each plot, you must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your information is true.

    <div id="analysis3Plot1"></div>
    <p id="analysis3Eqn1" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
      </p>
      <ul>
            <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
            <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
            <li>Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li>
            <li>A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or remain stable the consumption of electric energy.</li>
      </ul>

    <ul>
         <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
         <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
         <li>Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$ people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li>
         <li>A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation between these two variables.</li>
