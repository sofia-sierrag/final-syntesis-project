<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic

</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
